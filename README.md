# Braxton M | UCBC6_WeatherDashboard | README

The objective of the Weather Dashboard assignment is to work with an API (Open Weather Map) to create a website 
that will display the current and future five day forecast of any searched city. Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed 
will be available to each day searched and the UV Index will be shown to the current forecast of that city. 
The UV index will display a different color based on the scale of the index returned. The Previous 5 cities searched by
the user will be created as buttons that will store the data of those cities for easy access for the user.


## Acceptance Criteria


```

THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
